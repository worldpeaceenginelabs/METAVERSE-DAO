# Cloud Atlas: A Vision of Decentralized Digital Governance - A decentralized, digital government of the people, run by the people, for the people

### In this era of profound transformation, we stand poised to embrace a revolutionary paradigm shift that will redefine how we coexist and interact. While navigating daily challenges, a pressing need emerges for a unified platform capable of addressing issues spanning outdoor spaces, homes, schools, workplaces, and the complex domains of law and politics.

### Let us depart from the culture of competition, blind obedience to authority,  understaffing or sheer ignorance, transcending into an era where the pillars of knowledge, compassion, and collaboration form the foundation of our society. This evolution beckons us to engage our intellect, emotions, and instincts in a holistic manner, guiding our actions and communications.

### Imagine a platform akin to fixmystreet.com, but elevated to a scale that befits a science fiction utopia‚Äîa platform worth the name fixmyworld.com, empowering us to cohesively nurture and elevate our global community. üåçüöÄ

### The Technological Singularity, often feared as a future where AI outpaces humanity, holds a unique place in our discourse. Its definition posits, "The technological singularity is a hypothetical future point at which technological growth spirals beyond control, birthing unforeseeable changes in human civilization." (neutral yet assertive)

### A plausible real-world scenario: Let's envision the Technological Singularity as a future state in which we unquestionably adhere to the directives of government-controlled ChatGPTs, even if these instructions were blatantly incorrect or inaccurate, driven by the fear of government penalties or repressive measures for non-compliance. This concept prompts reflections on historical human group dynamics, religious movements, and even cults or sects. It is remarkably reminiscent of our present relationship with existing governments, institutions, schools and workplaces, where avenues for addressing bugs, critical issues, or improvement feedback are often lacking, effectively creating a comparable sense of helplessness. This situation can be regarded as a modern manifestation of a Technological Singularity.

### Moreover, this parallels two other well-known entities: money, essentially a mathematical construct designed to shape human behavior, and language, which encompasses rules and rhetoric intended to guide human actions. These, too, can be perceived as distinct forms of Technological Singularities.

### You see, the Technological Singularity is not merely one event in a distant future; it comprises multiple events, some of which we are already experiencing.

### But what if we could engineer a Technological Singularity that defies the ominous scenarios? What if, instead, it embodies values that promote collective well-being, freedom of expression, and harmonious progress?

### This is the essence of Cloud Atlas: a glimpse into a world where technology serves as a catalyst for positive evolution, unity, and a shared human experience.

### The first version of Cloud Atlas will contain only The Tools of Change - Reverse Engineering Applied (TOC-RA) in a browser based app, coming 2023, but then...

# ATTENTION

### We are currently in the Beta phase of developing our platform and creating the first decentralized applications (dApps). We are eagerly awaiting the developer community to join us with their ideas and concepts. During this Beta phase, the globe will only be displayed as a 2D surface. However, once we or our users release dApps, we will unlock the map data in accordance with the needs of the dApp with the most demand for spatial detail. This means that if a 2D model is sufficient for the intended use of a dApp, we will not unlock the more resource-intensive 3D option, which "costs" bandwidth in terms of performance and sustainability. We are working on a step-by-step realization of our [DTile](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/DTILE) concept.

##### This is what the globe and your applications looks like in 3D
