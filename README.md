# Cloud Atlas: A Vision of Decentralized Digital Governance - A decentralized, digital government of the people, run by the people, for the people

### In this era of profound transformation, we stand poised to embrace a revolutionary paradigm shift that will redefine how we coexist and interact. While navigating daily challenges, a pressing need emerges for a unified platform capable of addressing issues spanning outdoor spaces, homes, schools, workplaces, and the complex domains of law and politics.

### Let us depart from the culture of competition, blind obedience to authority,  understaffing or sheer ignorance, transcending into an era where the pillars of knowledge, compassion, and collaboration form the foundation of our society. This evolution beckons us to engage our intellect, emotions, and instincts in a holistic manner, guiding our actions and communications.

### Imagine a platform akin to fixmystreet.com, but elevated to a scale that befits a science fiction utopia‚Äîa platform worth the name fixmyworld.com, empowering us to cohesively nurture and elevate our global community. üåçüöÄ

### The Technological Singularity, often feared as a future where AI outpaces humanity, holds a unique place in our discourse. Its definition posits, "The technological singularity is a hypothetical future point at which technological growth spirals beyond control, birthing unforeseeable changes in human civilization." (neutral yet assertive)

### A plausible real-world scenario: Let's envision the Technological Singularity as a future state in which we unquestionably adhere to the directives of government-controlled ChatGPTs, even if these instructions were blatantly incorrect or inaccurate, driven by the fear of government penalties or repressive measures for non-compliance. This concept prompts reflections on historical human group dynamics, religious movements, and even cults or sects. It is remarkably reminiscent of our present relationship with existing governments, institutions, schools and workplaces, where avenues for addressing bugs, critical issues, or improvement feedback are often lacking, effectively creating a comparable sense of helplessness. This situation can be regarded as a modern manifestation of a Technological Singularity.

### Moreover, this parallels two other well-known entities: money, essentially a mathematical construct designed to shape human behavior, and language, which encompasses rules and rhetoric intended to guide human actions. These, too, can be perceived as distinct forms of Technological Singularities.

### You see, the Technological Singularity is not merely one event in a distant future; it comprises multiple events, some of which we are already experiencing.

### But what if we could engineer a Technological Singularity that defies the ominous scenarios? What if, instead, it embodies values that promote collective well-being, freedom of expression, and harmonious progress?

### This is the essence of Cloud Atlas: a glimpse into a world where technology serves as a catalyst for positive evolution, unity, and a shared human experience.

### The first version of Cloud Atlas will contain only The Tools of Change - Reverse Engineering Applied (TOC-RA) in a browser based app, coming 2023, but then...

# ATTENTION

### We are currently in the Beta phase of developing our platform and creating the first decentralized applications (dApps). We are eagerly awaiting the developer community to join us with their ideas and concepts. During this Beta phase, the globe will only be displayed as a 2D surface. However, once we or our users release dApps, we will unlock the map data in accordance with the needs of the dApp with the most demand for spatial detail. This means that if a 2D model is sufficient for the intended use of a dApp, we will not unlock the more resource-intensive 3D option, which "costs" bandwidth in terms of performance and sustainability. We are working on a step-by-step realization of our [DTile](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/DTILE) concept.

##### This is what the globe and your applications looks like in 3D

Introducing Cloud Atlas, the [Digital Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Earth#Next-generation_digital_Earth) ([EU Digital Earth concept](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/scientific-activities-z/digital-earth_en)) developed by World Peace Engine Labs that is set to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us. Think of it as a decentralized version of Google Earth, but with a lot more capabilities.

With Cloud Atlas, you can explore stunning UE5 content, games, and applications on any device, including browser, mobile, desktop, and VR. But that's not all. You can also experience Wikipedia articles in 3D and engage with them on a whole new level. Each article has an artificial identity, which means they can communicate with each other and identify conflicting information, which they will forward as pull-requests to the Wikipedia community. This helps maintain the accuracy of Wikipedia and promotes collaboration on knowledge among users.

But Cloud Atlas is more than just a platform for exploration and learning. It also provides a social network where people from different backgrounds can come together to brainstorm solutions to local and global issues. With the power of in-person meetups, crowdfunding, and petitions, you can turn your ideas into reality and make a difference in the world.

And that's not all. Cloud Atlas also features MissionTV, a decentralized platform similar to YouTube or Twitch, but with a focus on showcasing good deeds. With built-in live-chat and donation options, MissionTV provides an easy way to share your achievements and inspire others to do good.

But what if you want to create your own apps and features for Cloud Atlas? That's where Metaverse-DAO comes in. Our simple and intuitive red dot system allows users to request apps, features, bug-fixes, and improvements, which are then tackled by our talented community of developers. And if you want to fund your requested feature or app yourself or request community donations and crowdfunding, you can do that too. This creates a huge marketplace for development jobs and incentivized contributions, making app development more accessible and democratic than ever before.

And the best part? All updates and new apps are available to all users for free!

We believe that the potential for Metaverse-DAO is enormous, and we're excited to see it evolve into the future of app development. 
Join us on Cloud Atlas and be a part of this exciting new community today. Together, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.

In most countries, homeschooling is allowed under certain conditions, generally speaking, if the teacher is qualified. What could be more obvious than a digital teacher that can be programmed to meet these qualifications?

Welcome T.E.A.C.H.E.R - an innovative educational system that revolutionizes the way we educate our children. With T.E.A.C.H.E.R, children can interact with AI according to their interests, and the learning speed is entirely up to the child. What's more, discussed topics are stored in their personal curriculum, and if there are any missing topics compared to the general curriculum, they are suggested more often to the child.

Imagine your child completing 13 years of school in just 5 years, studying topics like quantum physics and rocket-science for fun, or even becoming a doctor at the age of 14. With T.E.A.C.H.E.R, that's not just a dream, it's a possibility!

But that's not all - our system offers many advantages over traditional schooling. The curriculum is accessible online to parents and the public, making it more democratic, and allowing for feedback through surveys, petitions, and crowdfunding. It's also verifiable that the system is child-friendly, and social circles are not compulsively mixed, which can lead to problems and bullying. Children can strengthen their own social circles by spending more time with family and friends.

We understand that social mixing is essential for the natural development of adolescents, but we believe it should be voluntary with the option to leave the scene, which is not always possible in traditional schools. And the ultimate feature for kids in our system is that they can design the teacher's look with Unreal's META-HUMAN, which will give them their first contact with information technology and AI that they can develop from day one.

In summary, T.E.A.C.H.E.R offers a more personalized and efficient approach to education, allowing children to explore their interests and reach their full potential. With our system, your child decides topics and speed. Join us in revolutionizing education for a better future.

# Matter (a cluster of atoms), ChatGPT, and humans are alike in that we are all defined by our connectome.<br>"I AM MY CONNECTOME"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67427045/225616299-0a6e2dee-39fd-4578-9d20-654fc6d218cd.png)
This is a human connectome.

Cloud Atlas is a revolutionary new platform that combines the concept of the connectome with the cutting-edge technology of ChatGPT to create a virtual world of collective knowledge. Like humans, ChatGPT processes vast amounts of information and generates responses based on its accumulated knowledge and understanding of the world. The structure in which the "dataset" is stored is the connectome.

By making ChatGPT and humans share one united connectome, the Cloud Atlas creates a Digital Earth of interconnected knowledge. Using browser technology, Cloud Atlas renders the complex interconnections of connectomes as visible connections between Wikipedia articles, creating a holistic virtual world where updates to Wikipedia articles are reflected in real-time changes to the environment.

Cloud Atlas promises to revolutionize the way we access and share information, and has the potential to increase participation and collaboration in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding oneself and the world around us. This will raise the overall participation in knowledge in general and the extension and correction of Wikipedia articles especially.

Imagine being able to walk through a virtual world of interconnected information, where every step leads to a new discovery, and every interaction contributes to the collective understanding of our world. With Cloud Atlas, the possibilities are endless.

We believe that this platform will have a significant impact on the way we learn and share information, bringing us closer to a future where knowledge is accessible to all. Join us on this exciting journey towards a future of shared knowledge and collective intelligence.
