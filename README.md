### In ten years' time, the world will be a different place. Everyone will be a user or follower in this digital network. Everyone likes instructions on how we should think or live. But what if this technology that connects us so closely can actually help us instead of harming us?

### I stand before you today not just as a dreamer but as the creator of a vision, a future in which technology is not our downfall but our salvation. I have created a concept that is not only revolutionary but also life-changing.

### It's an app that evolves with us and supports us in ways that previously seemed unimaginable. An app that not only stands for individual success but for the cohesion of an entire society. How? Through a groundbreaking engine that puts the traditional practices of indigenous tribes at the center - community care and cohesion.

### This app inspires helpful deeds, mobilizing each and every one of us to do good. But that's not all. It's done through the lens of social justice, guided by ethical methods. We are creating a platform that is not just based on algorithms but on values deeply rooted in our humanity.

### I have created the future - an app that helps us without harming us. A place we can turn to for fair care. A place where everyone is seen and heard. No one will ever be alone again. All our needs will be met, and our lives can be radically transformed.

### Think about how this app, this revolution, can drive not only technology but also humanity. We have the power to shape a future characterized not just by likes, dislikes, and followers but by compassion and unity. Together, we can create a world where no one is left behind, and everyone can reach their full potential. This is our responsibility; this is our opportunity. Let's shape this future together!

### Inspired by the World Peace Game of Buckminster Fuller: ‚ÄúMake the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.‚Äù

### ‚ÄúYou never change things by fighting against the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the old model obsolete.‚Äù Buckminster Fuller<br>

### In this era of profound transformation, we stand poised to embrace a revolutionary paradigm shift that will redefine how we coexist and interact. While navigating daily challenges, a pressing need emerges for a unified platform capable of addressing issues spanning outdoor spaces, homes, schools, workplaces, and the complex domains of law and politics.

### Let us depart from the culture of competition, blind obedience to authority,  understaffing or sheer ignorance, transcending into an era where the pillars of knowledge, compassion, and collaboration form the foundation of our society. This evolution beckons us to engage our intellect, emotions, and instincts in a holistic manner, guiding our actions and communications.

### Imagine a platform akin to fixmystreet.com, but elevated to a scale that befits a science fiction utopia‚Äîa platform worth the name fixmyworld.com, empowering us to cohesively nurture and elevate our global community. üåçüöÄ

### The Technological Singularity, often feared as a future where AI outpaces humanity, holds a unique place in our discourse. Its definition posits, "The technological singularity is a hypothetical future point at which technological growth spirals beyond control, birthing unforeseeable changes in human civilization." (neutral yet assertive)

### A plausible real-world scenario: Let's envision the Technological Singularity as a future state in which we unquestionably adhere to the directives of government-controlled ChatGPTs, even if these instructions were blatantly incorrect or inaccurate, driven by the fear of government penalties or repressive measures for non-compliance. This concept prompts reflections on historical human group dynamics, religious movements, and even cults or sects. It is remarkably reminiscent of our present relationship with existing governments, institutions, schools and workplaces, where avenues for addressing bugs, critical issues, or improvement feedback are often lacking, effectively creating a comparable sense of helplessness. This situation can be regarded as a modern manifestation of a Technological Singularity.

### Moreover, this parallels two other well-known entities: money, essentially a mathematical construct designed to shape human behavior, and language, which encompasses rules and rhetoric intended to guide human actions. These, too, can be perceived as distinct forms of Technological Singularities.

### When a single animal incorporates a newly learned behavior that better adapts to its environment than the overall behavior of its species into its "society", it unintentionally gives rise to unforeseeable changes within that species' "civilization" and, consequently, impacts the civilizations of all other species.

### Still talking about Technological Singularitys, this effect is referred to as non-linear systems. For example, prior to the law against using mobile devices while driving, people were focused on the road while using their phones. However, with the introduction of this law, people began using their mobile devices covertly, diverting their attention away from the road. When a government incorporates a new law into its society, it unintentionally gives rise to unforeseeable changes within that nations' civilization, and consequently, impacts the civilizations of all other nations. (prerole model for other governments, tourists, etc...)

### Statistics serve as evidence for this observation, and decision-makers now comprehend that they could not have predicted this non-linear outcome with todays tools, which Cloud Atlas is about to change!

### You see, the Technological Singularity is not merely one event in a distant future; it comprises multiple, interdisciplinary events, some of which we are already experiencing.

<br>

### But what if we could engineer a Technological Singularity that defies the ominous scenarios? What if, instead, it embodies values that promote collective well-being, freedom of expression, and harmonious progress?

### This is the essence of Cloud Atlas: a glimpse into a world where technology serves as a catalyst for positive evolution, unity, and a shared human experience.

### The first version of Cloud Atlas will contain only The Tools of Change in a browser based app, coming 2024, but then...

# ATTENTION

### We are currently in the Beta phase of developing our platform and creating the first decentralized applications (dApps). We are eagerly awaiting the developer community to join us with their ideas and concepts. During this Beta phase, the globe will only be displayed as a 2D surface. However, once we or our users release dApps, we will unlock the map data in accordance with the needs of the dApp with the most demand for spatial detail. This means that if a 2D model is sufficient for the intended use of a dApp, we will not unlock the more resource-intensive 3D option, which "costs" bandwidth in terms of performance and sustainability. We are working on a step-by-step realization of our [DTile](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/DTILE) concept.

##### This is what the globe and your applications looks like in 3D

Introducing Cloud Atlas, the [Digital Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Earth#Next-generation_digital_Earth) ([EU Digital Earth concept](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/scientific-activities-z/digital-earth_en)) developed by World Peace Engine Labs that is set to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us. Think of it as a decentralized version of Google Earth, but with a lot more capabilities.

With Cloud Atlas, you can explore stunning UE5 content, games, and applications on any device, including browser, mobile, desktop, and VR. But that's not all. You can also experience Wikipedia articles in 3D and engage with them on a whole new level. Each article has an artificial identity, which means they can communicate with each other and identify conflicting information, which they will forward as pull-requests to the Wikipedia community. This helps maintain the accuracy of Wikipedia and promotes collaboration on knowledge among users.

But Cloud Atlas is more than just a platform for exploration and learning. It also provides a social network called 'Tools of Change' where people from different backgrounds can come together to brainstorm solutions to local and global issues. With the power of in-person meetups to put your brainstorming results into action, crowdfunding, and petitions, you can turn your ideas into reality and make a difference in the world.

And that's not all. Cloud Atlas also features MissionTV, a decentralized platform similar to YouTube or Twitch, but with a focus on showcasing good deeds. With built-in live-chat and donation options, MissionTV provides an easy way to share your achievements and inspire others to do good.

But what if you want to create your own apps and features for Cloud Atlas? That's where Metaverse-DAO comes in. Our simple and intuitive red dot system allows users to request apps, features, bug-fixes, and improvements, which are then tackled by our talented community of developers. And if you want to fund your requested feature or app yourself or request community donations and crowdfunding, you can do that too. This creates a huge marketplace for development jobs and incentivized contributions, making app development more accessible and democratic than ever before.

And the best part? All updates and new apps are available to all users for free!

We believe that the potential for Metaverse-DAO is enormous, and we're excited to see it evolve into the future of app development. 
Join us on Cloud Atlas and be a part of this exciting new community today. Together, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.

# METAVERSE-DAO | CLOUD ATLAS and T.E.A.C.H.E.R. will be run separately but merged into the project named DarkMatterResponse (inspired by His Dark Materials)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67427045/225636646-e34d3022-bb91-4b5b-a2f3-0964a4c39e5c.png)

In most countries, homeschooling is allowed under certain conditions, generally speaking, if the teacher is qualified. What could be more obvious than a digital teacher that can be programmed to meet these qualifications?

Welcome T.E.A.C.H.E.R - an innovative educational system that revolutionizes the way we educate our children. With T.E.A.C.H.E.R, children can interact with AI according to their interests, and the learning speed is entirely up to the child. What's more, the discussed topics are marked as "done" in a child's personal curriculum. If there are any missing topics compared to the official school curriculum for children of their age in traditional schools, these topics are simply suggested more frequently to a child of the same age. The T.E.A.C.H.E.R. adapts to the child, and not the other way around. That's what we desire and will love!

Imagine your child completing 13 years of school in just 5 years, studying topics like quantum physics and rocket-science for fun, or even becoming a doctor at the age of 14. With T.E.A.C.H.E.R, that's not just a dream, it's a possibility!

But that's not all - our system offers many advantages over traditional schooling. The curriculum is accessible online to parents and the public, making it more democratic, and allowing for feedback through surveys, petitions, and crowdfunding. It's also verifiable that the system is child-friendly, and social circles are not compulsively mixed, which can lead to problems and bullying. Children can strengthen their own social circles by spending more time with family and friends.

We understand that social mixing is essential for the natural development of adolescents, but we believe it should be voluntary with the option to leave the scene, which is not always possible in traditional schools. And the ultimate feature for kids in our system is that they can design the teacher's look with Unreal's META-HUMAN, which will give them their first contact with information technology and AI that they can develop from day one.

In summary, T.E.A.C.H.E.R offers a more personalized and efficient approach to education, allowing children to explore their interests and reach their full potential. With our system, your child decides topics and speed. Join us in revolutionizing education for a better future.

# Matter (a cluster of atoms), ChatGPT, and humans are alike in that we are all defined by our connectome.<br>"I AM MY CONNECTOME"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67427045/225616299-0a6e2dee-39fd-4578-9d20-654fc6d218cd.png)
This is a human connectome.

Cloud Atlas is a revolutionary new platform that combines the concept of the connectome with the cutting-edge technology of ChatGPT to create a virtual world of collective knowledge. Like humans, ChatGPT processes vast amounts of information and generates responses based on its accumulated knowledge and understanding of the world. The structure in which the "dataset" is stored is the connectome.

By making ChatGPT and humans share one united connectome, the Cloud Atlas creates a Digital Earth of interconnected knowledge. Using browser technology, Cloud Atlas renders the complex interconnections of connectomes as visible connections between Wikipedia articles, creating a holistic virtual world where updates to Wikipedia articles are reflected in real-time changes to the environment.

Cloud Atlas promises to revolutionize the way we access and share information, and has the potential to increase participation and collaboration in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding oneself and the world around us. This will raise the overall participation in knowledge in general and the extension and correction of Wikipedia articles especially.

Imagine being able to walk through a virtual world of interconnected information, where every step leads to a new discovery, and every interaction contributes to the collective understanding of our world. With Cloud Atlas, the possibilities are endless.

We believe that this platform will have a significant impact on the way we learn and share information, bringing us closer to a future where knowledge is accessible to all. Join us on this exciting journey towards a future of shared knowledge and collective intelligence.
