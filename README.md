# What's stopping you from creating right now? Your creations will never be limited to just one environment again.

Welcome to Metaverse-DAO | Cloud Atlas.

We've created a starter kit that empowers creators like you to build their own dApps, add features, fix bugs, and make improvements for the Cloud Atlas community, your own community, or just for yourself. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to create their own digital world on our Digital Earth, regardless of coding skills or experience.

And we have some exciting news to share: we're shifting all the work to Unreal Engine 5 and Unity 3D from now on. So don't worry too much - the latest updates of this repository have only been text-based.

With our platform, your UE5/Unity3D dApp can be wrapped in a bubble and placed on the Digital Earth's surface, making it easily discoverable by users around the globe.

Your JAMstack, Webcontainers and WASM creations will be seamless by nature.

Although we are still working on perfecting it, we are fully committed to ensuring a seamless user experience as they transition between different bubbles. Our goal is to eliminate any perceived loading time for the new bubble, allowing your users to effortlessly move between the globe, games, and serious applications. (Devs and Users will have the option to preserve their stats and items as they transition between bubbles. We utilize GunJS mostly as a decentralized alternative to Dropbox or Firebase for sharing stats and items across various bubbles.)

We aim to provide a Metaverse, Sword Art Online, Astrometrics, Holodeck-like experience.

Our platform is designed to enable decentralization, so your creative projects are not limited to our platform. We will always guide you in making your UE/Unity3D bubbles, JAMstack, Webcontainers, and WASM creations standalone products that can be used independently. Your dapp card, available in the dapp-store, will provide a simple and interactive way for you to connect with your favorite networks, such as Steam, Epic Games, Windows Store, Green Man Gaming,  and more, and even everywhere a PWA can be listed (mobile and desktop stores). This will help to promote your work and reach a broader audience.

So what's stopping you from creating right now? Your creations will never be limited to just one environment again.

 We've been working hard to find the simplest way for us to share our separate digital worlds (our dApps), while uniting them all in one Digital Earth. And we've finally found it.

Join us today and start realizing your creative potential!

# ATTENTION

### We are currently in the Beta phase of developing our platform and creating the first decentralized applications (dApps). We are eagerly awaiting the developer community to join us with their ideas and concepts. During this Beta phase, the globe will only be displayed as a 2D surface. However, once we or our users release dApps, we will unlock the map data in accordance with the needs of the dApp with the most demand for spatial detail. This means that if a 2D model is sufficient for the intended use of a dApp, we will not unlock the more resource-intensive 3D option, which "costs" bandwidth in terms of performance and sustainability. We are working on a step-by-step realization of our [DTile](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/DTILE) concept.

##### This is what the globe and your applications looks like in 3D

Introducing Cloud Atlas, the [Digital Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Earth#Next-generation_digital_Earth) ([EU Digital Earth concept](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/scientific-activities-z/digital-earth_en)) developed by World Peace Engine Labs that is set to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us. Think of it as a decentralized version of Google Earth, but with a lot more capabilities.

With Cloud Atlas, you can explore stunning UE5 content, games, and applications on any device, including browser, mobile, desktop, and VR. But that's not all. You can also experience Wikipedia articles in 3D and engage with them on a whole new level. Each article has an artificial identity, which means they can communicate with each other and identify conflicting information, which they will forward as pull-requests to the Wikipedia community. This helps maintain the accuracy of Wikipedia and promotes collaboration on knowledge among users.

But Cloud Atlas is more than just a platform for exploration and learning. It also provides a social network where people from different backgrounds can come together to brainstorm solutions to local and global issues. With the power of in-person meetups, crowdfunding, and petitions, you can turn your ideas into reality and make a difference in the world.

And that's not all. Cloud Atlas also features MissionTV, a decentralized platform similar to YouTube or Twitch, but with a focus on showcasing good deeds. With built-in live-chat and donation options, MissionTV provides an easy way to share your achievements and inspire others to do good.

But what if you want to create your own apps and features for Cloud Atlas? That's where Metaverse-DAO comes in. Our simple and intuitive red dot system allows users to request apps, features, bug-fixes, and improvements, which are then tackled by our talented community of developers. And if you want to fund your requested feature or app yourself or request community donations and crowdfunding, you can do that too. This creates a huge marketplace for development jobs and incentivized contributions, making app development more accessible and democratic than ever before.

And the best part? All updates and new apps are available to all users for free!

We believe that the potential for Metaverse-DAO is enormous, and we're excited to see it evolve into the future of app development. 
Join us on Cloud Atlas and be a part of this exciting new community today. Together, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.

# METAVERSE-DAO | CLOUD ATLAS and T.E.A.C.H.E.R. will be run separately but merged into the project named DarkMatterResponse (inspired by His Dark Materials)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67427045/225636646-e34d3022-bb91-4b5b-a2f3-0964a4c39e5c.png)

In most countries, homeschooling is allowed under certain conditions, generally speaking, if the teacher is qualified. What could be more obvious than a digital teacher that can be programmed to meet these qualifications?

Welcome T.E.A.C.H.E.R - an innovative educational system that revolutionizes the way we educate our children. With T.E.A.C.H.E.R, children can interact with AI according to their interests, and the learning speed is entirely up to the child. What's more, discussed topics are stored in their personal curriculum, and if there are any missing topics compared to the general curriculum, they are suggested more often to the child.

Imagine your child completing 13 years of school in just 5 years, studying topics like quantum physics and rocket-science for fun, or even becoming a doctor at the age of 14. With T.E.A.C.H.E.R, that's not just a dream, it's a possibility!

But that's not all - our system offers many advantages over traditional schooling. The curriculum is accessible online to parents and the public, making it more democratic, and allowing for feedback through surveys, petitions, and crowdfunding. It's also verifiable that the system is child-friendly, and social circles are not compulsively mixed, which can lead to problems and bullying. Children can strengthen their own social circles by spending more time with family and friends.

We understand that social mixing is essential for the natural development of adolescents, but we believe it should be voluntary with the option to leave the scene, which is not always possible in traditional schools. And the ultimate feature for kids in our system is that they can design the teacher's look with Unreal's META-HUMAN, which will give them their first contact with information technology and AI that they can develop from day one.

In summary, T.E.A.C.H.E.R offers a more personalized and efficient approach to education, allowing children to explore their interests and reach their full potential. With our system, your child decides topics and speed. Join us in revolutionizing education for a better future.

# Matter (a cluster of atoms), ChatGPT, and humans are alike in that we are all defined by our connectome.<br>"I AM MY CONNECTOME"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67427045/225616299-0a6e2dee-39fd-4578-9d20-654fc6d218cd.png)
This is a human connectome.

Cloud Atlas is a revolutionary new platform that combines the concept of the connectome with the cutting-edge technology of ChatGPT to create a virtual world of collective knowledge. Like humans, ChatGPT processes vast amounts of information and generates responses based on its accumulated knowledge and understanding of the world. The structure in which the "dataset" is stored is the connectome.

By making ChatGPT and humans share one united connectome, the Cloud Atlas creates a Digital Earth of interconnected knowledge. Using browser technology, Cloud Atlas renders the complex interconnections of connectomes as visible connections between Wikipedia articles, creating a holistic virtual world where updates to Wikipedia articles are reflected in real-time changes to the environment.

Cloud Atlas promises to revolutionize the way we access and share information, and has the potential to increase participation and collaboration in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding oneself and the world around us. This will raise the overall participation in knowledge in general and the extension and correction of Wikipedia articles especially.

Imagine being able to walk through a virtual world of interconnected information, where every step leads to a new discovery, and every interaction contributes to the collective understanding of our world. With Cloud Atlas, the possibilities are endless.

We believe that this platform will have a significant impact on the way we learn and share information, bringing us closer to a future where knowledge is accessible to all. Join us on this exciting journey towards a future of shared knowledge and collective intelligence.

# Prologue for METAVERSE-DAO DEVS
Hi fellow developers,

I would like to offer an opportunity for you to continue doing what you do best - contributing to various libraries such as iris, cesium, gun, webtorrent, and other p2p, security, privacy, and spatial libraries that we use regularly. Your contributions will be automatically integrated into METAVERSE-DAO, a platform where we can collaborate and bring ideas from the lab to practice together. Think of it like a dev hop-on hop-off concept with no strings attached.

I have discovered many Github repositories that, if bootstrapped, can provide incredible decentralization features. However, they often remain unused, collecting dust and waiting to be utilized for their intended purpose.

Can you imagine anything better than an open-source, multipleProtocols based metaverse as a decentralized playground for developers? I know I can't!

Thank you in advance for contributing to your favorite libraries, and feel free to contact me anytime.

Best regards, Bo
<br><br>

# [QUICKSTART FOR CODING DEVS (jump to Quickstart)](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/METAVERSE-DAO_CLOUD-ATLAS/blob/master/README.md#quickstart-for-components-and-dapps-the-decentralized-back-end)

### This project is built using the JAMstack, which stands for Javascript, API, and Markup (HTML and CSS).
#### It also uses the Vite bundler and Svelte as a compiler(not as a language!). The project was started by running ```npm create vite@latest``` and choosing Svelte/TS in the installation prompt (not Svelte-kit!). It is pre-configured for edge-builds and fast hot-reload.

### By using Svelte, you can take advantage of its logic, like page=component and it's built-in reactivity. This allows you to create single-page applications [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) without the need for DOM manipulation. Instead of routing you're using imports, links and modals. Some of the Svelte [bindings](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/text-inputs) are also available for use. However, you won't need Svelte specific features like slots or stores. The project is written in TypeScript, but nothing TypeScript-specific is required. Its just Vanilla JS at the end, and the project is compiled statically, but without loosing reactivity, so it can be dropped on the edge(CDN) without the need for a node server. The project also has fast hot-reload, even as it gets larger. (dev dream 🤤👍)

### The back-end of the project is split into 200 CDNs (domain and build files) and decentralized GUNJS DB Relays (graph-database). To use GUN, refer to the guide at "jump to Quickstart" and don't forget to spin up a [GUN Relay.](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/METAVERSE-DAO_CLOUD-ATLAS/blob/master/README.md#gun-relays)
<br>

```
../App.svelte

// every page is also a component, and every component is also a page.
// page/component files (.svelte) are seperated into script, markup and css

<script lang="ts">Typescript (logic) goes here</script>

<markup>html goes here</html>

<css>css goes here</css>),
```

### If you choose to use Unreal Engine, you can create high-quality content with real-world environments using Cesium for Unreal, even if you don't know how to code at all. This is already impressive, but if you are a coder, it's even more mind-blowing! You can then connect your creation to a specific location on the globe using longitude and latitude coordinates with a tap or a mouseclick, as explained in the Quickstart for Coding Devs section.

### Whether you're an experienced coder or just starting out, you can have fun being creative and join the  [METAVERSE-DAO | CLOUD ATLAS Community Chat](https://gitter.im/METAVERSE-GUN/community) if you have any questions or want to share your component or dapp.

# GUN Relays

Using public (stranger) relays can pose a risk because they may be wiped at any time. However, this may not necessarily be a significant problem. Instead, developers of gun applications should prioritize the local graph on the client-side, as the relay primarily serves the purpose of syncing, not long-term storage. If the intention is to rely on relays for long-term storage, this technology is not yet mature enough for that purpose. But again, the local graph client-side is your long-term storage. Find the balance between deduplication and availablility.

At Cloud Atlas, we utilize GunJS mostly as a decentralized alternative to Dropbox or Firebase for sharing stats and items across various bubbles. Devs and users will have the option to preserve their stats and items as they transition between bubbles.

<br>

## For end-users
### The project is an open-source, decentralised digital twin of the real-world using CesiumJS, with the ability to connect to Unreal Engine 5. It also includes decentralised communication capabilities through Iris, GUN, and Webtorrent, allowing for text, file, voice, and video communication from anywhere on the planet.

### The project owes a big thank you to the communities behind the Iris, Cesium, and Gun libraries and protocols that make this possible. It's an excellent foundation for building an open-source metaverse, don't you agree?
<br>

## For developers and creators
### METAVERSE-DAO is a platform that includes the necessary programs to create a meta-verse, such as audio and video systems, as well as digital versions of governments, banking systems, and Web 2.0 tools. These tools help in the development and maintenance of the created world, and the platform is built on Web 3.0 technology so that it can run on multiple smaller servers instead of relying on one large server or farm like centralized services. (plus every user device(client) becomes a server too)

### One exciting feature of METAVERSE-DAO is that it allows accounts to transfer data from one Seed-based world to another, preserving their stats and progress. This means that users don't have to start from scratch when switching between worlds that use METAVERSE-DAO as their "game" engine.

### All meta-verses created using METAVERSE-DAO are part of the interconnected network called META-VERSE-NEXUS.

# QUICKSTART for components and dapps (the decentralized back-end)

## This is pretty much the core of everything. Notice how easy it is to connect your front-end code with the graph database GUN.
## This script saves a long/lat pair to the GUN graph, and renders a point on the globe, if the local clients graph or a connected graph (GUN-Relay) gets a new entry. (the ```.on``` subscribes to the GUN graph, everything new to the graph (local client graph and/or relay graph) will automatically be rendered on the globe)
## Notice that no matter how complex your function is: You just drop the result in a variable and connect it to the GUN write function (green boxes, green lines).
## Last, you can easily receive the data in any function, again, no matter how complex, by ```db.on(data => {//your function here});``` and get the data that you wrote to GUN before (red boxes, red lines)

[see original file](https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/METAVERSE-DAO_CLOUD-ATLAS/blob/master/src/Cesium.svelte#L232)

# This starter-kit is actually pretty mighty, but easy to create with, even for coding-beginners and for people who do not code at all! (last bullet point) 

- If Cesium JS is your thing, you can easily customize the above object blueprint (// Cesium constructor) to render something else ([CesiumJS is a mighty lib](https://cesium.com/learn/ion-sdk/ref-doc/))
- But from my experience, i prefer to use the point as a position and a tag, on which i render something else the usual JS way. For instance i connect a canvas or rather a modal, button, link, or whatever, with the point via markup (HTML) or/and JS(Document.getElementById() for instance), and keep it close to the point with CSS.
- If you go for Cesium for Unreal Engine 5, you can make these points your reference points.
- For beginners? Well, in Unreal Engine 5, you can code games, applications etc. in C#, or you wire the so called [UE blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/GettingStarted/)
- [This guy](https://wccftech.com/bright-memory-infinite-interview-zeng-on-raytracing-next-gen-and-december-target-release-date/) made a whole game with Blueprints only (you can combine this with Cesium for Unreal, since its just another plug-in on the UE market for UE, a real-world map/level import for your UE game /application)

He says today:
"Yes, I am still using Blueprints to work on my game development. Because I have only worked as a 3D environment artist but I have no programming experience. So I am also very grateful that the Unreal engine supports a strong Blueprints system."

# Mockups

### In manufacturing and design, a mockup, or mock-up, is a scale or full-size model of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes. A mockup may be a prototype if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design.

# Iris Messenger ✅

### See Iris Messenger live in action: https://iris.to/

**Want social media where _you_ decide what gets into your feed, not some obscure algorithm? Something that can't be censored by authoritarian governments? No big tech companies that decide what you can post, what gets visibility and who gets to have an account? Yet no harassing troll accounts, spam or ads? Something that works locally even if ISPs are unavailable in an emergency situation?**

Here comes Iris. Iris is a social networking application that stores and indexes everything on the devices of its users and connects directly with peers who run the application - no corporate gatekeepers needed.

## Public and private messaging
Interface-wise, Iris is not too different from some existing social media. You can post texts, photos, videos, audio or other types of files into your feed.

![Feed](https://github.com/irislib/iris/raw/master/img/feed.png)

You can also chat privately or participate in public group discussions.

## Web of trust
You can create new Iris accounts (technically: cryptographic keypairs) at will, without asking for anyone's permission, but only the users whose web of trust upvoted your account will see its posts.

When you upvote someone, they become your 1st degree contact. The accounts they upvoted become 2nd degree contacts. Then there are 3rd degree contacts and so on. This is the web of trust, which can be used to filter all content on Iris. Hiding users by downvoting is also possible.

**This way we can avoid spam and other unwanted content without giving power to central moderators.**

You can also add to your contacts list and rate people and organisations who are not yet on Iris.
A decentralised web of trust, unlike certain big brother systems, could be a strong positive social force as envisioned in the blog post [Learning to Trust Strangers](https://medium.com/@mmalmi/learning-to-trust-strangers-167b652a654f). (Iris is evolved from thereby mentioned Identifi.)

## Attestations (identity verifications)
Keep your contact details up-to-date and ask for attestations from peers or specialised verifiers trusted by your WoT.

Use your Iris account for online authentication or identification on services that support it (browser extension and mobile app in development).

Crypto wallets could use Iris to connect human-recognizable identities to payment addresses. Encrypted messaging apps like Signal could use Iris to look up users instead of telecom-bound phone numbers.

If you lose access to your account (keypair), just create a new one and link it to your existing identity by asking for verifications from your web of trust.

## Name service
Through WoT attestations, Iris maps human readable names to public keys and other identity attributes, providing an alternative to centrally managed identifiers such as domain names, CA certificates, email addresses, phone numbers or social media handles.

Iris name search is interface-wise similar to many existing social media: instead of having to know someone's unique username, you can type in their non-unique natural name and get a dropdown list of matching contacts ordered by distance in your web of trust.

You can also do reverse name lookup, such as looking up a name for an unknown number that is calling you. Or you could look up who owns a bitcoin address - as perceived by your web of trust.

## Importing content from existing sources
An Iris message is digitally signed by the entity that verified its origin. In other words: message author and signer can be different entities, and only the signer needs to be on Iris.

For example, a crawler can import and sign other people's messages from Twitter. Only the users who trust the crawler will see the messages.

Importing content from existing sources helps overcome the network effect. It solves the chicken and egg problem, making Iris a useful medium even with no initial user base.

## Tech stack
The [browser application](https://github.com/irislib/iris-messenger) runs on Preact. [Iris-electron](https://github.com/irislib/iris-electron) wraps it for desktop and adds peer sync over wifi (multicast).

[Iris-mobile](https://github.com/irislib/iris-mobile) is a React Native implementation (in development).

[Iris-lib](https://github.com/irislib/iris-lib) contains the core functionality of Iris that can be integrated to other applications. It is written in javascript for the browser and Node.js.

The task of data storage and networking is outsourced to [GUN](https://github.com/amark/gun), which manages the synchronization of data between different storages: RAM, localstorage, GUN websocket server, WebRTC peers, LAN multicast peers, IPFS (no adapter yet), S3 or others.

GUN enables subscription to data changes, so message feeds and identity profiles just update real-time without having to hit f5 or writing complex update logic.

[WEBTORRENT](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) is used to store file attachments and message backups.

## Iris relay

#### ROD - Rust Object Database (non-wasm rust port of gun)
You can add them from within the iris.to settings  menu. Sourcecode: https://github.com/mmalmi/rod

## Improving decentralisation
Currently the weak point of Iris's decentralisation is the list of initial peers, which could easily be blocked by governments or ISPs. By default, the application connects to IPFS default peers and a couple GUN peers. You can always add peers manually on the [settings page](https://irislib.github.io/#settings), but that is cumbersome for the average user.

[Iris-electron](https://github.com/irislib/iris-electron) and the upcoming mobile application can synchronize with peers on the same local area network. Bluetooth modules are not yet implemented, but will enable ad hoc networks of peers that need to meet each other only occasionally.

On the wide area network level, trusted contacts could exchange network addresses privately to avoid having them blocked or tracked. WebRTC's NAT traversal capabilities can enable direct connections between typical network endpoint users, but you still need a firewall-opened/port-forwarded rendez-vous node for them, and in some cases a relay node.

If you want to integrate Iris with your product or service, please check out [iris-lib](https://github.com/irislib/iris-lib) and create Github issues if needed
