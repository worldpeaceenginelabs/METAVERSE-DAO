    content: 'In most countries, home schooling is allowed under certain conditions, generally speaking, if the teacher is qualified. What could be more obvious than a Digital Teacher that can be programmed to meet these qualifications? And why not complete 13 school years in just 5 years and then do some quantum physics for fun or become a 14 years old doctor? After all, lessons are fun now and the teacher answers all questions without  exception, and even brain-storms the kid\'s / student\'s ideas with them. ADVANTAGES: 1. The curriculum is accessible online to parents and the public, commentable, democratized. (survey, petition, crowd-funding) 2. Child-friendliness is now verifiable. 3. Social circles are not compulsively mixed, which brings problems and bullying (rich vs. poor children, national vs. foreign, strong vs. weak, loud vs. quiet, extrovert vs. introvert etc.) Such social mixing is very important for the natural development of the adolescent, but should be voluntary and with the possibility to leave the scene, which today\'s school does not provide. 4. And most importantly, their own social circle is strengthened. Kids don\'t have to go to school anymore, so they spend much more time with their family and friends. What a rich and beautiful experience for the maturing soul. ü•∞  ULTIMATE FEATURE FOR THE KIDS: The teacher\'s look can be designed with Unreal\'s META-HUMAN by the kids themself.
