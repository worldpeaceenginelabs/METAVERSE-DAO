Your task: Photograph places to fight the distortion and to create detail. Connect and render playful from Wikipedia articles (places, POIs, animals, plants, objects, materials, physics, chemistry, psychology articles and history) to its right counterparts / locations on the globe and in time (spatial timelapse), and check visually if the contents of the articles match reality. Don\'t forget to keep the Wikipedia articles up to date and reliable! Let us compile a language model from the Cloud Atlas then, or we just use ChatGPT, so the Virtual Encyclopedia will be able to describe itself on command (Oracle AI - pre-AGI - friendly AI-complete) Let\'s feed it with human rights, the laws and the sustainable development goals, medicinal records, etc., and then let it compare our daily authorities' behavior and decisions with these rules, as a service on your mobile, right when it happens (government and police, your judge, your boss, your doctor, your teacher, your parents, even your friend...). No penalties, because it's only about clearing the question of who is right! The following decisions are up to the participants but this time based on impartial truth (AGI - friendly AI-complete(both AI and user)) "Oh, it\'s a brain for both an AI and humanity, through which you can walk through!
