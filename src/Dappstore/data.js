After all, lessons are fun now and the teacher answers all questions without  exception, and even brain-storms the kid\'s / student\'s ideas with them. ADVANTAGES: 1. The curriculum is accessible online to parents and the public, commentable, democratized. (survey, petition, crowd-funding) 2. Child-friendliness is now verifiable. 3. Social circles are not compulsively mixed, which brings problems and bullying (rich vs. poor children, national vs. foreign, strong vs. weak, loud vs. quiet, extrovert vs. introvert etc.) Such social mixing is very important for the natural development of the adolescent, but should be voluntary and with the possibility to leave the scene, which today\'s school does not provide. 4. And most importantly, their own social circle is strengthened. Kids don\'t have to go to school anymore, so they spend much more time with their family and friends. What a rich and beautiful experience for the maturing soul. ü•∞  ULTIMATE FEATURE FOR THE KIDS: The teacher\'s look can be designed with Unreal\'s META-HUMAN by the kids themself.
